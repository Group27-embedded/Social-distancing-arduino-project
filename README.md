Social distancing device is a device that helps to identify and maintain a safe social distance. 
This project was created using an arduino uno.


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The social distancing gadget is capable of measuring  the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal
This characteristic makes the  portable electronic device suitable for assessing social distance among persons in real-time and assisting users in reducing their exposure to the coronavirus disease.
Because social distancing is not within societyâ€™s normal routines, people may not realize that they are not adhering to healthcare-expert recommendations.
It is preferable to employ portable electronic devices to give users with real-time social distancing notifications and to aid them in maintaining their relationships.
